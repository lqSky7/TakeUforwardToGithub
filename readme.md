# TakeUforward To GitHub 🚀

## Description

I instantly missed leetsync and gfg to github after switching to tuf+. Decided to make a chrome extension but failed miserably. Over the rest of my first semester, i started learning webdev from chaicode, when i reached backend dev part, i 
realized i now have some confidence in porting gfg to github extension to tuf+. Long story short, Both leetsync and gfg to github use their apis in some way (to fetch question and stuff) and tuf+ platform (being a paid one) doesn't have clear open apis.
So, the approach to this extension is completely different from leetsync and gfg to github. It fetches data from localstorage of tuf+ and scrapes stuff from the website (tailwind gives a lot of pain while scraping stuff). Thanks for coming to my ted talk, 
here's some ai generated readme.md for you.

## Features 💡

- **Effortless Integration**: Sync with takeuforward.org and TUF+ platforms like a pro.  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff**: Push questions, solutions, and more directly to your GitHub.  
- **Multi-Content Support**: Handles code snippets, questions, and extra notes without breaking a sweat.  
- **Quick Setup**: Intuitive configuration for a frustration-free experience.  
- **Future-Proof**: Safari support is on the horizon. 🦊  

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lqsky7/TakeUforwardToGithub.git
```
2. Enable developer mode in Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser like Edge).
For Safari users, hang tight – it's coming soon!

3. Load the unpacked extension:
Navigate to the repository's directory and select it as your extension source.


## Usage

All you need is a Chromium-based browser. Once installed, configure your repository settings via the extension's homepage and let the magic unfold. Safari users, we’ve got you covered in the next update!


## Example Workflow:
Open TUF+ and start solving questions.
Watch as the extension scrapes and pushes content to your GitHub in real time.
Click submit
🎉 Profit!
