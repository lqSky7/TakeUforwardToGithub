# TakeUforward To GitHub üöÄ

## Description

I instantly missed leetsync and gfg to github after switching to tuf+. Decided to make a chrome extension but failed miserably. Over the rest of my first semester, i started learning webdev from chaicode, when i reached backend dev part, i
realized i now have some confidence in porting gfg to github extension to tuf+. Long story short, Both leetsync and gfg to github use their apis in some way (to fetch question and stuff) and tuf+ platform (being a paid one) doesn't have clear open apis.
So, the approach to this extension is completely different from leetsync and gfg to github. It fetches data from localstorage of tuf+ and scrapes stuff from the website (tailwind gives a lot of pain while scraping stuff). Thanks for coming to my ted talk,
here's some ai generated readme.md for you.

## Features üí°

- **Effortless Integration**: Sync with takeuforward.org and TUF+ platforms like a pro.
- **Automate the Boring Stuff**: Push questions, solutions, and more directly to your GitHub.
- **Multi-Content Support**: Handles code snippets, questions, and extra notes without breaking a sweat.
- **Quick Setup**: Intuitive configuration for a frustration-free experience.
- **Future-Proof**: Safari support is on the horizon. ü¶ä

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lqsky7/TakeUforwardToGithub.git
```

2. Enable developer mode in Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser like Edge).
   For Safari users, hang tight ‚Äì it's coming soon!

3. Load the unpacked extension:
   Navigate to the repository's directory and select it as your extension source.

## Usage

All you need is a Chromium-based browser. Once installed, configure your repository settings via the extension's homepage and let the magic unfold. Safari users, we‚Äôve got you covered in the next update!

## Example Workflow:

Open TUF+ and start solving questions.
Watch as the extension scrapes and pushes content to your GitHub in real time.
Click submit
üéâ Profit!
